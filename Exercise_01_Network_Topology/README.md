# Exerciseâ€“1: Implementation of a Basic Network using Topologies in Packet Tracer

## 1. Implementing a Basic Network using Topologies in Packet Tracer

### Bus Topology

A bus topology is a network in which nodes are directly linked with a common half-duplex link. A host on a bus topology is called a station. In a bus network, every station will accept all network packets, and these packets generated by each station have equal information priority. A bus network includes a single network segment and collision domain.

#### Steps to Configure and Set Up Bus Topology

**Step 1:** First, open the Cisco Packet Tracer desktop and select the devices given below:

| S.NO | Device  | Model-Name  |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| 1.   | PC      | PC          |
| 2.   | Switch  | PT-Switch   |

**IP Addressing Table**:

| S.NO | Device | IPv4 Address | Subnet Mask     |
| ---- | ------ | ------------ | --------------- |
| 1    | pc0    | 192.168.0.1  | 255.255.255.0   |
| 2    | pc1    | 192.168.0.2  | 255.255.255.0   |
| 3    | pc2    | 192.168.0.3  | 255.255.255.0   |
| 4    | pc3    | 192.168.0.4  | 255.255.255.0   |

- Create a network topology as shown below in the image.
- Use an automatic connecting cable to connect the devices.

**Step 2:** Configure the PCs (hosts) with IPv4 addresses and Subnet Masks according to the IP addressing table given above.

- To assign an IP address to PC0, click on PC0.
- Go to Desktop > IP Configuration and enter the IPv4 configuration.
- Fill in the IPv4 address and subnet mask.
- Assign an IP address using the `ipconfig` command, or use the command terminal of the PC:

```bash
ipconfig <IPv4 address> <subnet mask> <default gateway (if needed)>
```

- Repeat the same procedure for the other PCs to configure them.

**Step 3:** Verify the connection by pinging the IP address of any host from PC0.

- Use the `ping` command to verify the connection.
- You should see replies from the targeted node on both PCs, confirming the connection.

### Star Topology

A star topology for a Local Area Network (LAN) is one in which each node is connected to a central connection point, such as a hub or switch. When a node tries to communicate with another node, the transmission happens through the central node. Star topology allows easy addition and removal of nodes but may face network degradation with too many nodes.

#### Steps to Set Up Star Topology

**Step 1:** Use a switch and link it to six end devices.
**Step 2:** Link every device to the switch.
**Step 3:** Assign IP addresses to each device.
**Step 4:** Transfer messages between devices and validate the connections.

**Command to check connections:**

```bash
ping <ip_address_of_any_device>
```

**Example:**

```bash
ping 192.168.1.4
```

### Ring Topology

Ring topology is a network arrangement where every device is linked to two other devices, forming a circular connection. Data is usually transmitted in one direction (unidirectional), but it can also be transmitted in both directions in a bidirectional ring.

#### Steps to Set Up Ring Topology

**Step 1:** Open the Cisco Packet Tracer desktop and select the following devices:

| S.NO | Device  | Model-Name  |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| 1.   | PC      | PC          |
| 2.   | Switch  | PT-Switch   |

**IP Addressing Table**:

| S.NO | Device | IPv4 Address | Subnet Mask     |
| ---- | ------ | ------------ | --------------- |
| 1    | pc0    | 192.168.0.1  | 255.255.255.0   |
| 2    | pc1    | 192.168.0.2  | 255.255.255.0   |
| 3    | pc2    | 192.168.0.3  | 255.255.255.0   |
| 4    | pc3    | 192.168.0.4  | 255.255.255.0   |

- Create a network topology as shown below in the image.
- Use an automatic connecting cable to connect the devices.

**Step 2:** Configure the PCs with IPv4 addresses and Subnet Masks.

- Use the IP configuration tool or `ipconfig` command to assign IP addresses:

```bash
ipconfig <IPv4 address> <subnet mask> <default gateway (if needed)>
```

**Step 3:** Verify the connection by pinging the IP address of any host from PC0.

- Use the `ping` command to check the connection.
- If replies are received, the connection is verified.

### Mesh Topology

In a mesh topology, every device sends its own signal to the other devices in the network, creating multiple pathways for data transmission.

#### Steps to Set Up Mesh Topology

**Step 1:** Open the Cisco Packet Tracer desktop and select the following devices:

| S.NO | Device  | Model-Name  |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| 1.   | PC      | PC          |
| 2.   | Switch  | PT-Switch   |

**IP Addressing Table**:

| S.NO | Device | IPv4 Address | Subnet Mask     |
| ---- | ------ | ------------ | --------------- |
| 1    | pc0    | 192.168.0.1  | 255.255.255.0   |
| 2    | pc1    | 192.168.0.2  | 255.255.255.0   |
| 3    | pc2    | 192.168.0.3  | 255.255.255.0   |
| 4    | pc3    | 192.168.0.4  | 255.255.255.0   |

- Create a network topology as shown in the image.
- Use automatic connecting cables to link devices.

**Step 2:** Configure the PCs with IPv4 addresses and Subnet Masks using the `ipconfig` command:

```bash
ipconfig <IPv4 address> <subnet mask> <default gateway (if needed)>
```

**Step 3:** Verify the connection by pinging the IP address of any host from PC0.

- Use the `ping` command to check the connection.
- If replies are received from the targeted nodes, the connection is verified.
